## Requirements
## CohortClock, a platform which capitalizes on smartphone technology and artificial intelligence algorithms to facilitate the collection and management of large-scale rhythmic behavior data. This platform is cross-compatible, seamlessly integrating with both Android (developed using Java) and iOS systems (developed using Swift), thereby ensuring broad accessibility to collect data and transmit it to the server. The server collects data using a MySQL database, and frontend web-based data management is achieved through the use of Flask and Vue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp
